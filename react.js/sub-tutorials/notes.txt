Declarative
- What should be done?

"Just tell me what to do, and i'll worry
 about how to get it done"


 Imperative
 - How should it be done?

 "Describe to me every step on how to do something,
 and I'll do it"


 1. Why do we need to 'import React from "react" in our files?

 We import react from 'react' in our files because it will tell
 the compiler to look for React inside of the module 'react' located
 in node modules.

 2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

 Logging console.log(page), if page is a component then it would return
 an empty function with no perimeters. If the page is a variable then,
 the console would return json. The json contains everything inside.

 3. What's wrong with this code:
 ```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website</p>
)
 ```

 The code is wrong and will cause an error in the compiler. This is because
 the tags must be nested within a <div></div> tag. The correct code looks
 as following:

```
 const page = (
    <div>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>This is my website</p>
    </div>
 )
```

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

Declarative means that everything is defined for what it should look like
in the end. Imperative means that the process of getting this is defined step
by step usually. Mockup language is usually declarative. React is declarative.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

React.js is composable because components can be made which can be reused.
Python is composable since functions can be created and the re-used. HTML is
by default not composable because everything has to be retyped.
