<h1>Chickens</h1>

<p>
  The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species,
  with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1]
  that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an
  adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has
  been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually
  immature female is called a pullet.

<p>
  Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were
  not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3]
  Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
  meat and eggs) and as pets.

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>
  An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an
  adult female is called a hen.[11][12] Other terms are: Biddy: a newly hatched
  chicken[13][14] Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a] Chick: a young
  chicken[15] Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
  Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17] Dunghill fowl: a
  chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18] Pullet: a
  young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a
  pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20] Yardbird:
  a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21] Chicken was originally a
  term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources,
  chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic
  fowl.[22][page needed][failed verification] Chicken may also mean a chick (see
  for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]

<h2>Etymology</h2>

<p>
  According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
  originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual
  connotation of the original English cock,[24][25][26] and is widely used
  throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at
  night.[27]
